     <h3>Make natural or minimally processed foods the basis of your diet</h3>
     <p>Natural or minimally processed foods, in great variety, and mainly of plant origin, are the basis for diets that are nutritionally balanced, delicious, culturally appropriate, and supportive of socially and environmentally sustainable food systems. Variety means foods of all types — cereals, legumes, roots, tubers, vegetables, fruits, nuts, milk, eggs, meat — and diversity within each type — such as beans and lentils, rice and corn, potato and cassava, tomatoes and squash, orange and banana, chicken and fish.</p>

    <div class="medium-2 columns step-number">2</div>
    <div class="medium-10 columns step-description">
     <h3>use oils, fats, salt, and sugar in small amounts when seasoning and cooking natural or minimally processed foods and to create culinary preparations</h3>
     <p>As long as they are used in moderation in dishes and meals based on natural or minimally processed foods, oils, fats, salt, and sugar contribute to diverse and delicious diets without making them nutritionally unbalanced.</p>
    </div>
   </div>

    <div class="medium-2 columns step-number">3</div>
    <div class="medium-10 columns step-description">
     <h3>Limit consumption of processed foods</h3>
     <p>The ingredients and methods used in the manufacture of processed foods — such as vegetables in brine, fruits in syrup, cheeses and breads — unfavourably alter the nutritional composition of the foods from which they are derived. In small amounts, processed foods can be used as ingredients in dishes and meals based on natural or minimally processed foods.</p>

    <div class="medium-2 columns step-number">4</div>
    <div class="medium-10 columns step-description">
     <h3>Avoid consumption of ultra-processed foods</h3>
     <p>Because of their ingredients, ultra-processed foods such as salty fatty packaged snacks, soft drinks, sweetened breakfast cereals, and instant noodles, are nutritionally unbalanced. As a result of their formulation and presentation, they tend to be consumed in excess, and displace natural or minimally processed foods. Their means of production, distribution, marketing, and consumption
damage culture, social life, and the environment.</p>

    <div class="medium-10 columns step-description">
     <h3>Eat regularly and carefully in appropriate environments and, whenever possible, in company</h3>
     <p>Make your daily meals at regular times. Avoid snacking between meals. Eat slowly and enjoy what you are eating, without engaging in another activity. Eat in clean, comfortable and quiet places, where there is no pressure to consume unlimited amounts of food. Whenever possible, eat in company, with family, friends, or colleagues: this increases the enjoyment of food and encourages eating regularly, attentively, and in appropriate environments. Share household activities that precede or succeed the consumption of meals.</p>

     <h3>Shop in places that offer a variety of natural or minimally processed foods</h3>
     <p>Shop in supermarkets and municipal and farmers markets, or buy directly from producers or other places, that sell varieties of natural or minimally processed foods. Prefer vegetables and fruits that are locally grown in season. Whenever possible, buy organic and agroecological based foods, preferably directly from the producers.</p>

     <h3>Develop, exercise and share cooking skills</h3>
     <p>If you have cooking skills, develop them and share them, especially with boys and girls. If you do not have these skills — men as well as women —acquire them. Learn from and talk with people who know how to cook. Ask family, friends, and colleagues for recipes, read books, check the internet, and eventually take courses. Start cooking</p>

    <div class="medium-10 columns step-description">
     <h3>Plan your time to make food and eating important in your life</h3>
     <p>Plan the food shopping, organise your domestic stores, and decide on meals in advance. Share with family members the responsibility for all activities related to meals. Make the preparation and eating of meals privileged times of conviviality
and pleasure. Assess how you live so as to give proper  time for food and eating.</p>

    <div class="medium-10 columns step-description">
     <h3>Out of home, prefer places that serve freshly made meals</h3>
     <p>Eat in places that serve fresh meals at good prices. Self-service restaurants and canteens that serve food buffet-style charged by weight are good choices. Avoid fast food chains</p>

    <div class="medium-10 columns step-description">
     <h3>Be wary of food advertising and marketing</h3>
     <p>The purpose of advertising is to increase product sales, and not to inform or educate people. Be critical and teach children to be critical of all forms of food advertising and marketing.</p>
